# Robin's Dotfiles
My dotfiles. All the configurations for my personal machines. 

I got most of my ideas from [dotfiles.github.io](https://dotfiles.github.io/) and it was great.
It had so many resources and I got to know that I can automate all the settings of my machine.
Even the applications that I need to install, the system preferences, all that stuff. 
I'm looking forward to actually adding other ways of automating things over here. 
If there are any ways to automate more, I'll let you guys know.
